NutriMatch is an AI-powered nutrition recommendation system that suggests personalized meals based on user preferences, dietary restrictions, and health goals using machine learning and data analysis.
# 🥗 NutriMatch — AI Powered Nutrition Recommendation System

NutriMatch is a machine learning–based nutrition recommendation system that provides personalized meal suggestions based on user preferences, dietary restrictions, and health goals.

The goal of this project is to help individuals make healthier food choices using data-driven insights and intelligent matching algorithms.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Many people struggle to choose meals that align with their:

* Health goals (weight loss, muscle gain, maintenance)
* Dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, allergies)
* Nutritional requirements (calories, protein, carbs, etc.)

NutriMatch solves this problem by recommending suitable meals based on user inputs using machine learning techniques.

## 🎯 Features

✅ Personalized meal recommendations
✅ Nutrition-based filtering
✅ User preference matching
✅ Health goal–oriented suggestions
✅ Data preprocessing and analysis
✅ Interactive user input system

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

The recommendation system uses similarity-based matching techniques to identify meals that best fit user requirements.

Steps involved:

1. Data Collection and Cleaning
2. Feature Engineering (nutrition values, categories)
3. Similarity Calculation / Matching Algorithm
4. Recommendation Generation
5. Output Visualization

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

(Optional if used)

* Streamlit / Flask (for deployment)

## 📊 How It Works

1. User enters preferences such as:

   * Calories
   * Diet type
   * Health goal
   * Nutrient focus

2. The system processes the data and finds similar meals.

3. Personalized recommendations are displayed.
